# Focus Cards is a lightweight task management app designed for users with attention regulation challenges such as ADHD. Instead of traditional to-do lists, tasks are presented as individual cards to reduce cognitive overload and help users focus on one task at a time. Each card contains a clear task goal and a supportive micro-hint that breaks the task into a smaller, more approachable step. Built with SwiftUI and powered by Firebase Firestore and Authentication, the app supports real-time cloud synchronization of user tasks, completion status, and filtering between pending and finished tasks.
