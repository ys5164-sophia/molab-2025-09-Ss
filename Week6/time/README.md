# In this project, I extended the original time-tracking app by adding local data persistence using UserDefaults and JSON encoding. Previously, all records only existed in memory and were lost when the app closed. I modified the data model to conform to Codable and implemented automatic saving and loading so that users’ daily activity records are preserved across app launches. This improvement turns the app from a temporary prototype into a usable long-term personal time-tracking tool.
