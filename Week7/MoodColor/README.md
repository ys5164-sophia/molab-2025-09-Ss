#In this project, I created an app named MoodColor using SwiftUI. It can automatically switch the background color and corresponding emoji image based on the user's input of emotional words such as "happy", "sad", "angry", etc. I imported icons of different emotions in Xcode's Assets and used a simple switch statement to make the interface display the corresponding color and image according to the emotional changes.
